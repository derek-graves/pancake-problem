# flipjack.

`flipjack.` is a prototype of an interactive implementation of the pancake problem, a classic prefix reversal problem in combinatorics. In its current state, it serves as a sandbox and visual tool for understanding and experimenting with the problem. It's built with simple visuals and intuitive mechanics.

## features

---

#### The Pancake Stack

Click on a pancake to flip the stack under that pancake. Each flip adds a new card to the stack history area on the right side of the window.

#### Stack Visuals

Select `both`, `pancakes', or `numbers` to change the display style of the pancake stack to your liking.

#### Interaction Modes

The default interaction mode is `flip`, which is how the user interacts with the stack in the pancake problem. To reorder the stack, select `drag` mode and click-and-drag the pancakes to reorder. Note, reordering pancakes resets the stack history.

#### Number of Pancakes

Use `add` and `remove` to change the number of pancakes in the stack. These actions also reset the stack history.

#### State Changes

`undo`, `redo`, and `reset` perform their expected actions, allowing the user to correct mistakes or return to a previous stack and stack history.

#### Stack History

Click on a card in the stack history area to
